## Rust Unit Converter: km <-> mi, hr <-> sec

This is my very first project while learning the Rust programming language!

This simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) application performs basic unit conversions:

Kilometers (km) to Metres (m) and vice-versa.

Hours (hr) to Seconds (sec) and vice-versa.

## Project Goal

*The primary goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of Rust, including:*

- Handling basic input/output (std::io).

- Parsing user input.

- Handling numeric data types (f64) and performing calculations.

## How to Build and Run

Clone the Repository
```rust
git clone [your-repo-link]
cd [project-name]
```

Run the application:
```assembly
cargo run

```
Follow the on-screen prompts to perform the conversions!

Built with Rust as part of my Today's Learning progress.
